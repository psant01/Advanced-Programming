This is a repository that holds the source code for the task set in unit 4 consolidate.

Task - To create a task management system using Python. This program will allow you to:

1. Create a new task consisting of a Task name, Date created and a due date
2. Allow you amend the Task name, date created or due date for a task
3. Delete a task from your list of tasks.

To create this task manager you are going to use the list data type, and each element in the task list
will itself consist of a list with three items (Task name, Creation date and due date.

In in addition to the above, a user should be able to retrive the current list of items
and display these in the terminal window.

Additiona challenge:

Create, when the program opens, a username and password challenge.
You should create a hard-coding example user in your code, and make a note of the
details provided by the user, and check these against the hard-coded (validated) user details in your program

If correct, you should then present a menu of options from the above that the user can select, and based on the
operation chosen, execute the code associated with this option.

Finally, you should encapsulate your code in a while loop which will contine until the user enters the option:
quit (as a string) - this should be added to your list of menu items.

If a user enters an incorrect username and password combination, an error should be raised, and the user should
have the option of trying to enter the correct details until the correct combination has been found.
